    <p>
        The Company provides scheduling, coordination, and fulfillment of residential laundry services, which may

        The Company reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">2. Pricing and Weight-Based Charges</h5>
    <p>a. Laundry services are priced by weight (per pound).</p>
    <p>b. Laundry weight is determined after pick-up and prior to processing.</p>
    <p>c. Any price estimates provided are non-binding and subject to adjustment based on actual measured weight.</p>
    <p>d. The final service charge shall be based on the actual weight processed and any applicable fees.</p>
    <p>e. Minimum service fees, surcharges, or promotional pricing may apply.</p>
